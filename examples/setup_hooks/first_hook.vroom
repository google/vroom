Tests in a directory automatically include .setup.vroomhook files present in the
same directory or any of its parents. These are setup hooks that can be used to
perform common setup procedures, such as defining macros or sourcing vimscript
files.

This directory has a .setup.vroomhook file so it's contents should have
been executed:

  first hook
  &
  @end
